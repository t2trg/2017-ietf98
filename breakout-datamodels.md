# How to Deal with Different Kinds of if Data Models?

## Agreeing on the problem statement

* We agree on the problem of different kinds of data models (different user stories, platform examples, ...)
* We agree that we want a solution for the current brownfield (each platform has already incentive to talk to others) 
* There might be a common information model or conception model above all the data models
* We expect that something harmonized will evolve eventually, but that needs natural selection of current data model features

## What is the way forward?

* Just pick one data model!
  * Will not work with the existing brownfield
  * Let's accept the plurality of platforms
* Common information model of the cross-platform use cases might help
  * Individual platforms have in incentive for communicating data to other ecosystems
  * There is agreement on the information that is supposed to be sent and detail of information that needs to be received
  * The use case IM can be mapped to the different data models including the intension ("turn on lights for the fire fighters does not care about HUE..")
* More formal or machine-understandable definition of each data model might help
  * Could automate the mapping
* There are different layers of information models
  * From the bottom, harmonization goes quite far up (..., IP, ..., serialization formats)
  * At the top, we have the conceptional model the humans in the loop have, but how far does it go down?
* What are the valuable parts of the current data models
  * They are the reason why domains do not want to drop their data models
  * Spreading those might help with evolving to the harmonized data model
